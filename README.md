# Spigot-Anti-Malware

This is a script created by me that runs a .jar file from a member of the Spigot staff to see if your plugins are infected before you put them on your server so you don't have to shut down your server to check every time you add a plugin to your server. Here's where my script comes in, it's that you can run it on your computer, and you don't even need to download the latest version of java. However, if you want to check your entire server, I'd advise you to go to the Spigot page and follow the instructions:

I'm just the creator of the .bat script!

creator of the jar file is [@Optic_Fusion1](https://github.com/OpticFusion1)
